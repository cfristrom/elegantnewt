				"title": "An Immense World by Ed Yong üìö",
				"content_html": "<p>This is a wonderful book which has taken me far too long to read due to the vagaries of library ebook holds. The author is a long-time science journalist who has taken the time to survey the history and current frontiers of research in non-human perception, including a wide range of in-person interviews, both in the lab and the field. The writing is spare, expressive, and detailed, with copious footnotes, many pages of citations, a huge bibliography, and a comprehensive index. There are also a number of color photos (collected at the back of the ebook edition).</p>\n<p>The book is organized in the logical fashion, covering each sense starting with the canonical five, which we humans have at least a chance of understanding, but then venturing into more exotic realms of echolocation, electroreception, and magnetoreception. The fundamental thesis is how difficult it is to really understand how other species actually perceive the world using senses which are so different in range, sensitivity, and even fundamental nature from our own, but by giving many examples and discussing how the science has evolved I felt I had at least made a start.

				"content_text": "This is a wonderful book which has taken me far too long to read due to the vagaries of library ebook holds. The author is a long-time science journalist who has taken the time to survey the history and current frontiers of research in non-human perception, including a wide range of in-person interviews, both in the lab and the field. The writing is spare, expressive, and detailed, with copious footnotes, many pages of citations, a huge bibliography, and a comprehensive index. There are also a number of color photos (collected at the back of the ebook edition).\n\nThe book is organized in the logical fashion, covering each sense starting with the canonical five, which we humans have at least a chance of understanding, but then venturing into more exotic realms of echolocation, electroreception, and magnetoreception.

More of my confusion has to do with which characters are dead and which are still living, as in the cosmology of the series death is still final but is a transition rather than an ending.</p>\n<p>And as the story progresses we are also learning more of the backstory of this cosmology. In <em>Harrow</em> we meet the God-Emperor and his remaining Lyctors, near immortal necromancers of immense power, opposed by immense Resurrection Beasts created in the deep past as a result of a vague necromantic cataclysm. The author does a good job of presenting these ten-thousand-year-old characters as a strange mix of human and transhuman, although that transhumanity and Harrow‚Äôs mental confusion does make it difficult to infer what their true motives are. The final chapters resolve some mysteries but introduce several new ones, as it becomes obvious that Harrow and Gideon have been caught up in the long range plots of the immortals and are only beginning to understand their roles (as was I as a reader).</p>\n<p>But when we get to <em>Nona</em> it turns out that (spoilers again) Harrow‚Äôs partial reintegration at the end of <em>Harrow</em> has gone wrong and she now has to relearn almost everything, having lost much of her memory of previous events. Some of the deep backstory of the Emperor is revealed in literal dream sequences, which I have have to assume can‚Äôt be relied on as a source of truth. Several of the characters from the previous stories appear here in new roles, and in the end it isn‚Äôt at all clear what has happened to any of them, including Harrow.

First, her grandmother was a hoarder, with piles of old newspapers, boxes of useless objects, and an entire room filled with creepy old dolls; but although at first this has the feel of a ghost story, she quickly learns that the otherworldly events which she encounters are of a different kind altogether, as she follows her dog up a mysterious path and ends up in a different place, with hills and strange standing stones, clearly not part of the flatlands near the house. The rest of the story is clearly Mythos-adjacent, as she has to make difficult decisions on how to deal with the strange and unexpected encounters on the other side. As with the author&rsquo;s other fantasies the world building is first rate, the other world is very <em>other</em>, the characters are engaging, and the writing excellent.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Hollow Places</em> we follow Carrot as she travels back to her uncle&rsquo;s combination house and museum of oddities to act as caretaker while he is in the hospital for knee surgery, and yes this does sound suspiciously similar to the other book. The museum itself put me in mind of the Mystery Shack from <em>Gravity Falls</em> (if you haven&rsquo;t watched this excellent animated series you should give it a try), but the invasion of the otherworldly is even more threatening, and the peril to Carrot and her companion even more dire. This version is even more Mythos-influenced, and the thread of the story even more convoluted, taking a number of unexpected turns (although yes, the maguffin does turn out to be the obvious one, not much of a spoiler I&rsquo;m afraid). We spend more time in the other world, which takes on a much larger and more inhuman dimension which is as horrifying as any Mythos stories I have read, and better thought out than most.</p>\n<p>There are other parallels between the two plots (and other works in the genre); both make use of quotes from books written by unknown persons in the past, which give hints and portents about what is to come; both protagonists are supported by plucky sidekicks; and given that both are first person, we know that Mouse and Carrot will make it through so that they can write down their own stories. One thing I don&rsquo;t think they share is a common universe; although they share many Mythos elements, they are not part of that world, or even of each other&rsquo;s; the other worlds which we encounter are too different and unique to fit together cleanly.</p>\n<p>Recommended if you like either the author or the Mythos; even more so for both.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

The theme was evening, night and dawn, and the singing was exquisite, in particular the performance of Allegri‚Äôs <em>Miserere</em>. We saw them perform a few years ago at the actual Festival, and they have only gotten better.</p>\n<p>Then today we drove down to New York and finally saw David Byrne‚Äôs <a href=\"https://album.link/us/i/1484015849\"><em>American Utopia</em></a> live at the St James Theater near Times Square, it was everything we hoped for and more, as our previous attempt to see the show had been preempted by the Omicron surge, so that we saw instead a concert performance by only part of the cast of a different program.
