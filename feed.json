The writing is clear and direct, arguing that when the federal government acts to help the disadvantaged that society as a whole benefits, rich and poor alike; but when wealth and power is concentrated in the hands of the few, when public programs are curtailed to prevent minorities from benefiting, when the country abandons the principles of democracy and equality, then only the elite few reap the benefits and the rest of us must deal with declining living standards, loss of opportunity, and in the worst cases conflict and war.</p>\n<p>The Civil War is the fulcrum on which the narrative turns, the primary example of minority rule and race-based privilege leading to catastrophic consequences.

				"content_html": "<p>I read the first book in this series (<a href=\"https://elegantnewt.blog/2020/09/09/gideon-the-ninth.html\"><em>Gideon the Ninth</em></a>) some time ago, and actually read the second (<em>Harrow the Ninth</em>) at some point but didn‚Äôt write a post, and now as soon as I finished the third volume (<em>Nona the Ninth</em>) I went back and re-read the first two in order to try and understand what the heck was going on. Yes, it is that complicated. It seems possible that I will need to do it again once the next (and perhaps concluding?) book comes out. So the following comments cover all three published volumes (the story so far) and may contain spoilers at least for the first.</p>\n<p>Much of my confusion results in the structure of the two narratives; each book continues the timeline of the previous from the point of view of Harrowhark Nonagesimus but (and here is the major spoiler) it turns out that Harrow‚Äôs point of view is an extreme example of an unreliable narrator, not because Harrow is a liar (she is loyal and honest) but because her fundamental personality has been changed and modified by earlier events to the point where she herself doesn‚Äôt really remember what has happened to herself and her companion/rival Gideon. More of my confusion has to do with which characters are dead and which are still living, as in the cosmology of the series death is still final but is a transition rather than an ending.</p>\n<p>And as the story progresses we are also learning more of the backstory of this cosmology. In <em>Harrow</em> we meet the God-Emperor and his remaining Lyctors, near immortal necromancers of immense power, opposed by immense Resurrection Beasts created in the deep past as a result of a vague necromantic cataclysm. The author does a good job of presenting these ten-thousand-year-old characters as a strange mix of human and transhuman, although that transhumanity and Harrow‚Äôs mental confusion does make it difficult to infer what their true motives are. The final chapters resolve some mysteries but introduce several new ones, as it becomes obvious that Harrow and Gideon have been caught up in the long range plots of the immortals and are only beginning to understand their roles (as was I as a reader).</p>\n<p>But when we get to <em>Nona</em> it turns out that (spoilers again) Harrow‚Äôs partial reintegration at the end of <em>Harrow</em> has gone wrong and she now has to relearn almost everything, having lost much of her memory of previous events. Some of the deep backstory of the Emperor is revealed in literal dream sequences, which I have have to assume can‚Äôt be relied on as a source of truth. Several of the characters from the previous stories appear here in new roles, and in the end it isn‚Äôt at all clear what has happened to any of them, including Harrow. Will the next volume resolve this question? We can‚Äôt really rely on Harrow to know what is going on, having traveled through so many transformations, obscure statements from immortals, confusing dreams, and several trips to and from the afterlife.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs hard to nail down the central theme of these linked stories; at one level we have an Emperor with strange powers opposed by a rebellion; at another level a coming of age story for Harrow and Gideon, young people with their own emerging powers thrown into a battle they don‚Äôt understand; and then there is the entire question of death and what comes after, the question of what each character owes to other people or society, and what each is prepared to do in order to gain or retain absolute power over the scattered worlds of humanity.

First, her grandmother was a hoarder, with piles of old newspapers, boxes of useless objects, and an entire room filled with creepy old dolls; but although at first this has the feel of a ghost story, she quickly learns that the otherworldly events which she encounters are of a different kind altogether, as she follows her dog up a mysterious path and ends up in a different place, with hills and strange standing stones, clearly not part of the flatlands near the house. The rest of the story is clearly Mythos-adjacent, as she has to make difficult decisions on how to deal with the strange and unexpected encounters on the other side. As with the author&rsquo;s other fantasies the world building is first rate, the other world is very <em>other</em>, the characters are engaging, and the writing excellent.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Hollow Places</em> we follow Carrot as she travels back to her uncle&rsquo;s combination house and museum of oddities to act as caretaker while he is in the hospital for knee surgery, and yes this does sound suspiciously similar to the other book. The museum itself put me in mind of the Mystery Shack from <em>Gravity Falls</em> (if you haven&rsquo;t watched this excellent animated series you should give it a try), but the invasion of the otherworldly is even more threatening, and the peril to Carrot and her companion even more dire. This version is even more Mythos-influenced, and the thread of the story even more convoluted, taking a number of unexpected turns (although yes, the maguffin does turn out to be the obvious one, not much of a spoiler I&rsquo;m afraid).

This is the opt-in system built into the OS and enabled on a per-state basis; it uses anonymous Bluetooth codes which are traded between nearby enabled phones, and now the owner of a phone which was near mine has reported a positive test.\nThe good news is the system tells me that the date of the possible exposure was 11 days ago, which puts it on the Sunday we flew home from Chicago; this indicates to me that it most likely occurred on the flight, or perhaps at the airport before or after. We were all vaccinated, boosted, and fully masked during this trip, and I have had several negative rapid tests since then, so I don‚Äôt think I was infected by this particular incident.\nThe bad news is that the support web site which tells you what to do when you receive these notifications just tells you to get tested, and at the moment finding a test is very difficult. We were lucky to have several rapid tests stockpiled from before the trip, but due to the Omicron surge it is almost impossible to obtain more rapid tests, and clinics which do PCR tests are currently overwhelmed.\nIt is also impossible to know if the unknown person reporting the positive test was contagious at the time of the exposure, and given that the incident took place almost two weeks ago it is near the end of the conventional 14 day limit for symptoms to manifest. Even if I was actually exposed it was probably not the Omicron variant, given its very fast growth rate.</p>\n",

This is the opt-in system built into the OS and enabled on a per-state basis; it uses anonymous Bluetooth codes which are traded between nearby enabled phones, and now the owner of a phone which was near mine has reported a positive test.\nThe good news is the system tells me that the date of the possible exposure was 11 days ago, which puts it on the Sunday we flew home from Chicago; this indicates to me that it most likely occurred on the flight, or perhaps at the airport before or after. We were all vaccinated, boosted, and fully masked during this trip, and I have had several negative rapid tests since then, so I don‚Äôt think I was infected by this particular incident.\nThe bad news is that the support web site which tells you what to do when you receive these notifications just tells you to get tested, and at the moment finding a test is very difficult. We were lucky to have several rapid tests stockpiled from before the trip, but due to the Omicron surge it is almost impossible to obtain more rapid tests, and clinics which do PCR tests are currently overwhelmed.\nIt is also impossible to know if the unknown person reporting the positive test was contagious at the time of the exposure, and given that the incident took place almost two weeks ago it is near the end of the conventional 14 day limit for symptoms to manifest. Even if I was actually exposed it was probably not the Omicron variant, given its very fast growth rate.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a pure SwiftUI feed reader which uses Text elements for most of the content, but using the iOS 14 SDK I had not yet implemented embedded links, as the Text element did not support attributed strings. This has changed with the new iOS 15 SDK, which adds an AttributedString struct which can be passed to Text elements in place of a String.</p>\n<p>In addition it is now possible to pass String values with a subset of Markdown formatting to Text elements directly, to create an AttributedString, and to create the Foundation basis NSAttributedString. But this does not always work as I expected.</p>\n<p>When I pass a String literal with Markdown I get the expected behavior; thus</p>\n<p><code>Text(&quot;**This** is a _test_ with a [link](https://elegantnewt.blog).&quot;)</code></p>\n<p>yields the expected result</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>This</strong> is a <em>test</em> with a <a href=\"https://elegantnewt.blog\">link</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However if I pass a reference to the same String to the Text element then the Markdown is not parsed:</p>\n<p><code>let str = &quot;**This** is a _test_ with a [link](https://elegantnewt.blog).&quot;</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<code>Text(str)</code></p>\n<p>results in</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>**This** is a _test_ with a [link](<a href=\"https://elegantnewt.blog\">https://elegantnewt.blog</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I use a string literal but try to inject the URL via interpolation I find that the link text is correct but is not marked as a link:</p>\n<p><code>let url = &quot;https://elegantnewt.blog&quot;</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<code>Text(&quot;**This** is a _test_ with a [link](\\(url)).&quot;)</code></p>\n<p>produces</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>This</strong> is a <em>test</em> with a link.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if I create an AttributedString instance using the same input, and then pass <em>that</em> to the Text element, I do get the correct result, although I need to verify that the construction succeeds:</p>\n<p><code>let markdown = &quot;**This** is a _test_ with a [link](\\(url)).&quot;</code><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<code>if let att = try?

				"content_text": "I've been working on a pure SwiftUI feed reader which uses Text elements for most of the content, but using the iOS 14 SDK I had not yet implemented embedded links, as the Text element did not support attributed strings. This has changed with the new iOS 15 SDK, which adds an AttributedString struct which can be passed to Text elements in place of a String.\r\n\r\nIn addition it is now possible to pass String values with a subset of Markdown formatting to Text elements directly, to create an AttributedString, and to create the Foundation basis NSAttributedString. But this does not always work as I expected.\r\n\r\nWhen I pass a String literal with Markdown I get the expected behavior; thus\r\n\r\n`Text(\"**This** is a _test_ with a [link](https://elegantnewt.blog).\")`\r\n\r\nyields the expected result\r\n\r\n> **This** is a _test_ with a [link](https://elegantnewt.blog).\r\n\r\nHowever if I pass a reference to the same String to the Text element then the Markdown is not parsed:\r\n\r\n\r\n`let str = \"**This** is a _test_ with a [link](https://elegantnewt.blog).\"`<br>\r\n`Text(str)`\r\n\r\nresults in\r\n\r\n> \\*\\*This\\*\\* is a \\_test\\_ with a \\[link\\](https://elegantnewt.blog).\r\n\r\nIf I use a string literal but try to inject the URL via interpolation I find that the link text is correct but is not marked as a link:\r\n\r\n`let url = \"https://elegantnewt.blog\"`<br>\r\n`Text(\"**This** is a _test_ with a [link](\\(url)).\")`\r\n\r\nproduces\r\n\r\n> **This** is a _test_ with a link.\r\n\r\nHowever, if I create an AttributedString instance using the same input, and then pass _that_ to the Text element, I do get the correct result, although I need to verify that the construction succeeds:\r\n\r\n`let markdown = \"**This** is a _test_ with a [link](\\(url)).\"`<br>\r\n`if let att = try? AttributedString(markdown: markdown) {`<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Text(att)`<br>\r\n`}`\r\n\r\nworks as expected:\r\n\r\n> **This** is a _test_ with a [link](https://elegantnewt.blog).\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, if I construct an NSAttributedString from the same Markdown string reference, I again get the correct rendering:\r\n\r\n`if let nsAtt = try? NSAttributedString(markdown: markdown),`<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`let att = try? AttributedString(nsAtt, including: AttributeScopes.SwiftUIAttributes.self) {`<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Text(att)`<br>\r\n`}`\r\n\r\nalso yields\r\n\r\n> **This** is a _test_ with a [link](https://elegantnewt.blog).\r\n\r\nBut I need to be careful about how I construct that NSAttributedString.

[Disclosure: I am that reader.] There are no fairies here, and only one explicit reference to the midsummer‚Äôs dream; the book is about fantasy, but the dreams are those of the writer, dreaming up the characters who populate her work, and the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù life of that same writer, who dreams of love and acceptance despite a lifetime of neglect and abuse from those closest to her, and the consequences of loss and mortality. There are mysteries and plots, characters who do terrible things for the wrong reasons, rebirths and self-sacrifices which change both those character‚Äôs fates and the fates of the worlds they live in.

You can get more info at:\n\n[micro.blog](https://micro.blog)\n\nIf adding one more app to your phone just to follow one person seems like too much trouble, you can bookmark my blog on the web at:\n\n[elegantnewt.blog](https://elegantnewt.blog)\n\nAlternatively, if you are using a feed reader (and yes, those still are a thing) you can subscribe to my feed at:\n\n[elegantnewt.blog/feed.xml](https://elegantnewt.blog/feed.xml)\n\nWe have nothing to lose but our chains.\n",
