The writing is clear and direct, arguing that when the federal government acts to help the disadvantaged that society as a whole benefits, rich and poor alike; but when wealth and power is concentrated in the hands of the few, when public programs are curtailed to prevent minorities from benefiting, when the country abandons the principles of democracy and equality, then only the elite few reap the benefits and the rest of us must deal with declining living standards, loss of opportunity, and in the worst cases conflict and war.</p>\n<p>The Civil War is the fulcrum on which the narrative turns, the primary example of minority rule and race-based privilege leading to catastrophic consequences.

Yes, it is that complicated. It seems possible that I will need to do it again once the next (and perhaps concluding?) book comes out. So the following comments cover all three published volumes (the story so far) and may contain spoilers at least for the first.</p>\n<p>Much of my confusion results in the structure of the two narratives; each book continues the timeline of the previous from the point of view of Harrowhark Nonagesimus but (and here is the major spoiler) it turns out that Harrow‚Äôs point of view is an extreme example of an unreliable narrator, not because Harrow is a liar (she is loyal and honest) but because her fundamental personality has been changed and modified by earlier events to the point where she herself doesn‚Äôt really remember what has happened to herself and her companion/rival Gideon. More of my confusion has to do with which characters are dead and which are still living, as in the cosmology of the series death is still final but is a transition rather than an ending.</p>\n<p>And as the story progresses we are also learning more of the backstory of this cosmology. In <em>Harrow</em> we meet the God-Emperor and his remaining Lyctors, near immortal necromancers of immense power, opposed by immense Resurrection Beasts created in the deep past as a result of a vague necromantic cataclysm. The author does a good job of presenting these ten-thousand-year-old characters as a strange mix of human and transhuman, although that transhumanity and Harrow‚Äôs mental confusion does make it difficult to infer what their true motives are. The final chapters resolve some mysteries but introduce several new ones, as it becomes obvious that Harrow and Gideon have been caught up in the long range plots of the immortals and are only beginning to understand their roles (as was I as a reader).</p>\n<p>But when we get to <em>Nona</em> it turns out that (spoilers again) Harrow‚Äôs partial reintegration at the end of <em>Harrow</em> has gone wrong and she now has to relearn almost everything, having lost much of her memory of previous events. Some of the deep backstory of the Emperor is revealed in literal dream sequences, which I have have to assume can‚Äôt be relied on as a source of truth. Several of the characters from the previous stories appear here in new roles, and in the end it isn‚Äôt at all clear what has happened to any of them, including Harrow. Will the next volume resolve this question? We can‚Äôt really rely on Harrow to know what is going on, having traveled through so many transformations, obscure statements from immortals, confusing dreams, and several trips to and from the afterlife.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs hard to nail down the central theme of these linked stories; at one level we have an Emperor with strange powers opposed by a rebellion; at another level a coming of age story for Harrow and Gideon, young people with their own emerging powers thrown into a battle they don‚Äôt understand; and then there is the entire question of death and what comes after, the question of what each character owes to other people or society, and what each is prepared to do in order to gain or retain absolute power over the scattered worlds of humanity. Death and necromancy are the absolute power in this universe, and it seems that absolute power corrupts those who use it in strange and inhuman ways; can Harrow and her friends overcome that inhumanity without themselves becoming the enemy they are opposing?</p>\n<p>Clearly I recommend these books, but I also suggest waiting for the next before even starting on the first. Also make sure to read all of the additional content at the end of <em>Harrow</em> before starting <em>Nona</em>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

The final chapters resolve some mysteries but introduce several new ones, as it becomes obvious that Harrow and Gideon have been caught up in the long range plots of the immortals and are only beginning to understand their roles (as was I as a reader).\n\nBut when we get to _Nona_ it turns out that (spoilers again) Harrow‚Äôs partial reintegration at the end of _Harrow_ has gone wrong and she now has to relearn almost everything, having lost much of her memory of previous events. Some of the deep backstory of the Emperor is revealed in literal dream sequences, which I have have to assume can‚Äôt be relied on as a source of truth. Several of the characters from the previous stories appear here in new roles, and in the end it isn‚Äôt at all clear what has happened to any of them, including Harrow. Will the next volume resolve this question? We can‚Äôt really rely on Harrow to know what is going on, having traveled through so many transformations, obscure statements from immortals, confusing dreams, and several trips to and from the afterlife.\n\nIt‚Äôs hard to nail down the central theme of these linked stories; at one level we have an Emperor with strange powers opposed by a rebellion; at another level a coming of age story for Harrow and Gideon, young people with their own emerging powers thrown into a battle they don‚Äôt understand; and then there is the entire question of death and what comes after, the question of what each character owes to other people or society, and what each is prepared to do in order to gain or retain absolute power over the scattered worlds of humanity. Death and necromancy are the absolute power in this universe, and it seems that absolute power corrupts those who use it in strange and inhuman ways; can Harrow and her friends overcome that inhumanity without themselves becoming the enemy they are opposing?\n\nClearly I recommend these books, but I also suggest waiting for the next before even starting on the first. Also make sure to read all of the additional content at the end of _Harrow_ before starting _Nona_.\n\n<img src=\"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12371707-L.jpg\" alt=\"Book cover for Harrow the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir, a figure wearing a black body suit with a bone cuirass and face painted in a skull mask, with skeletons in the background.\" title=\"Harrow the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir\" class=\"cover\">\n\n<img src=\"https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12903379-L.jpg\" alt=\"Book cover for Nona the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir, a figure in a dark dress flanked by a white dog and a skeleton, with planets in the sky behind.\" title=\"Nona the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir\" class=\"cover\">\n",
